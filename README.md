Project Description:

"Multi-Platform AI Rescheduler: Optimizing Your Time Across Calendars

This project develops an intelligent, AI-powered rescheduler that seamlessly integrates with multiple calendar platforms, including Google Calendar, Microsoft Teams Calendar, and potentially others in the future. It aims to unify your scheduling experience, automatically organizing tasks from Google Tasks and other task management systems around your events and commitments. By leveraging advanced AI algorithms, the rescheduler prioritizes tasks, intelligently identifies optimal time slots, and dynamically adjusts your schedule to maximize productivity and minimize context switching. This solution addresses the challenge of fragmented scheduling by providing a centralized, intelligent platform for managing your time across diverse calendar ecosystems."

Technologies Used:

Core Development:

Python: The primary programming language for backend logic, API integration, and AI development.
API Frameworks (Flask or FastAPI): For building the backend API to handle requests and responses.
Database (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, or similar):
PostgreSQL (Relational): For structured data storage, especially if you plan to implement complex relational task dependencies.
MongoDB (NoSQL): For flexible data storage, ideal for handling various calendar event and task formats.
OAuth 2.0: For secure user authentication and authorization across different calendar platforms.
Containerization (Docker): For consistent deployment and environment management.
Version Control (Git): For code management and collaboration (e.g., GitHub, GitLab).
Calendar and Task API Integration:

Google Calendar API: For accessing and manipulating Google Calendar events.
Google Tasks API: For managing tasks within Google Tasks.
Microsoft Graph API: For accessing and managing Microsoft Teams Calendar and other Microsoft 365 services.
Potentially other APIs: Depending on the other calendar platforms you want to integrate (e.g., Apple Calendar via CalDAV, etc.).
AI and Machine Learning:

Scikit-learn: For general machine learning tasks, such as time estimation and task prioritization.
TensorFlow or PyTorch: For deep learning tasks, such as predictive scheduling and NLP.
Natural Language Processing (NLP) Libraries (NLTK, spaCy, Transformers): For processing and understanding task descriptions and user input.
Time series analysis libraries (e.g., Pandas, statsmodels): for analysis of calendar event patterns.
Cloud Infrastructure (Optional, but recommended for production):

Cloud Platform (AWS, Google Cloud, Azure): For hosting the application, database, and AI models.
Serverless Functions (AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions, Azure Functions): For scalable and cost-effective execution of specific tasks.
Cloud Storage (AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, Azure Blob Storage): For storing data and files.
User Interface (Optional):

React, Angular, or Vue.js: For building a dynamic and responsive web-based user interface.
HTML, CSS, JavaScript: For basic web development.
Testing and Monitoring:

Unit testing frameworks (pytest, unittest): For ensuring code quality.
Logging libraries: For tracking application events and errors.
Monitoring tools (Prometheus, Grafana): For performance monitoring and alerting.
